# DataStructuresAssignment2
This code was written by Zachary Adam in February 2016 for Data Structures at the University of Pittsburgh. 
It uses stacks to convert infix expressions to postfix expressions and simultaneously evaluate them. 
It allows for variables, which can be named using any alphabetic character. The uppercase and lowercase versions of the same letter
are treated as different variables. The program prompts the user for the value of the variable at runtime.
